# the-right-price
I created a Python "Guess the Price" app. Users guess the correct price of an item. It includes rules, random price generation, user input handling, feedback, and a replay option. Engaging and interactive, it enhances estimation skills. Developed using functions, loops, and conditionals. Enjoy the game!
